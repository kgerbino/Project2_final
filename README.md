# Project2_final
This is my final project for BIMM 143, introduction to bioinformatics. Scientific question: Is it possible that the delta variant of the Covid-19 virus, which has a higher infection rate especially in vaccinated individuals, came from a different natural reservoir than the original Covid-19 virus, or did it arise from evolution and natural selection in the human population? Hypothesis: If the delta variant of the Covid-19 virus arose through natural selection within the human population then its AA sequence will be more similar to the original Covid-19 virus than any other natural or intermediate host's coronaviruses.
