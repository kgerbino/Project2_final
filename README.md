# Project2_final
This is my final project for BIMM 143, introduction to bioinformatics. Scientific question: Is it possible that the delta variant of the Covid-19 virus, which has a higher infection rate especially in vaccinated individuals, came from a different natural reservoir than the original Covid-19 virus, or did it arise from evolution and natural selection in the human population? Hypothesis: If the delta variant of the Covid-19 virus arose through natural selection within the human population then its AA sequence will be more similar to the original Covid-19 virus than any other natural or intermediate host's coronaviruses. 

In order to test this hypothesis we will be using several different bioinformatics methods such as multiple sequence alignment and a phylogenetic tree to answer the hypothesis and scientific question. 

You will need four fasta sequences in order to run this code. The four fasta files are found on the PDB website, For each of them click the link and then the blue "download files" in the top right. Make sure to select it as a "fasta sequence" file.
